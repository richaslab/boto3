Clients
------------------
Low level service access

import boto3

# Create a low-level client with the service name
sqs = boto3.client('sqs')

Resources
------------------
Resources represent an object-oriented interface to Amazon Web Services (AWS). They provide a higher-level abstraction than the raw, low-level calls made by service clients. To use resources, you invoke the resource() method of a Session and pass in a service name:

# Get resources from the default session
sqs = boto3.resource('sqs')
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
